# Connect-Four
The game of Connect Four is a simple and interesting game played on a
grid with six rows and seven columns. Two players take turns taking
tokens and dropping them into one of the seven columns, where it falls
down to either the bottom if the column is currently empty or to the top of
the pile if it is not.

The goal of the game is to get four of your tokens in a row, up and down,
side to side, or diagonally, before the other player does.
